xbmc-xstream-plugin
===================

a fork of the well-known xbmc-plugin for online-streaming services.  
contributions are welcome and appreciated.  


why the fork ?
--------------
* contact to the former (or current?) author(s) seems to be very difficult to establish
* no way of contributing newly added plugins
* maintenance of the package seemed to be very sporadic and unreliable.
* code layout was a mess (and we're dealing with python here... ;) so that says smth..)
* the plugin itself is great - so dont reinvent smth good - just get it back on track


status
------

current development status: 2.0.21-alpha  
latest version: 2.0.21a2  
tested on: appletv 2, osx 10.8.3
